        <h2>Template Page - CHANGE TO PAGE NAME</h2>
        <p>This is a Template page. I've built it so that 
        I can easily copy it and then just change the 
        contents to match the page I am working on.</p>
        <p>This is a 2nd sample paragraph for the template page.
        I will change it or delete it depending on the assignment I create form it.
