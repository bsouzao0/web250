<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Brenda S. Oliveira</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course 
contract in my Spring 2025, WEB250, Database Driven Websites with my
instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen</p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online 
tools will be available to the world, and will not put information 
there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep 
private.</p>
    
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in 
assignments may show as absences.</p>
